    <p>Dear Nyx,</p>
    <p>Welcome to our lands. I was expecting you eagerly, but, unfortunately, due to unforseen circumstances, I was unable to meet you when you visited my castle. I am extremely dissatisfied with my transgression and I would like to make amends, by inviting you to my tower for a formal dinner.</p>
    <p>Sleep well, get some rest and make yourselves comfortable. Tomorrow night I will make sure to send a carriage; it will arrive at your camp at 12 o'clock, sharp</p>
    <p class="right">Sincerely, Lucius</p>
